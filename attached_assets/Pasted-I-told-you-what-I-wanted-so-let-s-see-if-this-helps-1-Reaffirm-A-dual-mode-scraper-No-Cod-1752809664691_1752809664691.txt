I told you what I wanted so let's see if this helps...

1. Reaffirm 
    A dual‑mode scraper (No‑Code wizard + Pro‑Code snippets/CLI).
    A dark‑mode, Shodan‑style UI with Clippy guiding the user.
    A robust engine under the hood (HTTP workers + Puppeteer + proxy support).
    API/CLI integrations and export to geo‑formats (GeoJSON/KML), tables, CSV, mirrors, etc.

That full list is absolutely achievable—but it’s a lot to build all at once. So let’s break it down into two phases:
2. Phase 1: MVP (4–6 weeks)

Goal: Get a working, polished “Clippr” scraper into users’ hands, with the core experience and Clippy in place.
Features

    Clippy Assistant UI

        ClippyAssistant.svelte in the bottom‑right corner.

        4‑step wizard: URL → Depth & Filters → Run → Download ZIP.

        stepTo(n) hints and basic animations.

    No‑Code Wizard

        Input Start URL, Depth slider, File‑type checkboxes (.geojson, .kml, .html, etc.).

        Live preview of CSS/XPath selector extraction for a single page.

        Run button that kicks off a backend job.

    Backend Scraper

        HTTP workers only (no headless Chrome yet).

        Configurable depth & filters, single‑domain restriction.

        Simple local‑filesystem export (project folder mirror + manifest.json).

    Basic Project Management

        Create & list “projects” in a small Postgres table (name, start URL, depth, filters, status).

        View job status and click “Download ZIP.”

    Clean Dark UI

        SvelteKit + Tailwind, dark navy background + neon accents.

        Left nav: Dashboard (job list), New Scrape, Settings.

    CLI (optional stretch)

        A one‑binary clippr command:

        clippr scrape \
          --url "https://..." \
          --depth 2 \
          --include geojson,kml \
          --out ./output.zip

Deliverables

    Monorepo scaffold: /web, /api, /cli.

    Full UI with Clippy integration.

    Backend service (Express or NestJS minimal) and Postgres schema.

    Dockerfiles and a GH Actions workflow for build & test.

    End‑to‑end demo: user runs a scrape, sees Clippy guide them, and downloads their files.

3. Phase 2: Full‑Feature Platform (3–4 months)

Goal: Layer in all the advanced capabilities once the MVP is stable.

    Hybrid Rendering: add Puppeteer‑core support for JS sites.

    Distributed Proxies: integrate ScraperAPI/Crawlbase and rotation.

    Scheduler & Watcher: recurring & webhook‑triggered jobs.

    API & gRPC: full remote orchestration, scoped API keys.

    Plugin Marketplace: auth modules, custom parser plugins.

    3D Globe Dashboard: D3/Three.js Earth visualization with live QPS gauge.

    Analytics Tab: charts for requests, latency, errors.

    Team Management: roles, project sharing.
